        users (each, “you” or “User“) and is committed to protect the privacy of Users who access, download, install or
        register to our mobile application, our website located at https:/// (the “Site”).
        Our “services” has the same meaning as defined in the Terms of Service. They include the Dmaster app, which can
        be accessed on mobile, web, desktop, console, or even a connected home appliance—any device with a web browser
        and internet connection. We also have a website, blog, and support center, and we may collect your information
        through other means like surveys, emails, and social media.</div>
      <br>
      <h3>B.The information we collect</h3>
      <br>
      <div>We collect certain information when you use Dmaster. This includes information you provide to us, information
        we collect automatically, and information we receive from other sources.</div>
      <br>
      <h4>1.Information you provide to us</h4>
      <br>
      <h5>Such information may include:</h5>
      <div><span class="bold">Account Information: </span>When you sign-up and register to the Services, you will be
        asked to provide us certain details about yourself. You may register to the Services through your social network
        account or directly through the Application or our website (if applicable).</div>
      <br>
      <div><span class="bold">Registering through social network account: </span>When you register or sign-in to the
        Services via your social network account (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.), we will have access to basic
        information from your social network account, such as your full name, home address, email address, birthdate,
        profile picture, friends list, personal description, as well as any other information you made publicly
        available on such account or agreed to share with us. At all times, we will abide by the terms, conditions and
        restrictions of the social network platform.</div>
      <br>
      <div><span class="bold">Registering through the Application or our website (if applicable): </span>When you
        register to the Services through the Application or our website, we may collect from you the following
        information: full name, email address, home address, hometown, nationality, birthdate, phone number, as well as
        information required for our compliance with regulatory Know Your Customer requirements, such as passport or
        other identification number, and any other information you agreed to share with us.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div><span class="bold">Purchase information: </span>If you buy any paid services through Dmaster, you may need to
        submit a valid payment method and associated billing information, including your full name and billing address.
        Our payment processors, like Stripe and PayPal, receive and process your payment information. Depending on the
        processor, we may also receive and store certain billing information, including the last four digits of the
        credit card number associated with the transaction. If we decide to process our own payments in the future, we
        would receive and process this information ourselves.
      </div>
      <br>
      <div><span class="bold">Information used to enable optional features: </span>Certain features, like contact
        syncing, may require that you provide additional information (or grant us access to such information) to make
        them work. This also includes information about third party integrations you choose to enable and the data you
        authorize those third party services to share with us. For example, when you link a music streaming account, we
        may collect information about that account such as the song you are listening to in order to display that
        information on your profile or as your status (if you have chosen to do so).
      </div>
      <br>

        voluntarily. For instance, when you respond to communications from us, communicate with us via email or share
        additional information about yourself through your use of the Services. We may also collect the feedback,
        suggestions, complaints and reports which you send to us. Please note that we may also collect complaints about
        you from other Users, which may include your Personal Information.</div>

      <br>
      <div><span class="bold">Other information that we collect automatically: </span>When you take certain actions on

        Similarly, we may also receive certain information when you click on a referral link, such as which website you

        limited.</div>
